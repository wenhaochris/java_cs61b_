Arraycopy:
Two ways to copy arrays:
1. Item by item using a loop.
2. using arraycopy. Takes 5 parameters:
    Source array
    Start position in source
    Target array
    Start position in target
    Number to copy

arraycopy is (likely to be) faster, particularly for large arrays. More compact code.
Code is (arguably) harder to read.
